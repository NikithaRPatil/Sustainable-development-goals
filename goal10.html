        <h2>Reduce inequality within and among countries</h2>
        <p>Income inequality is on the riseâ€”the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income, whereas the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. Taking into account population growth in developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent.</p>
        <p>Income inequality has escalated in nearly every region in recent decades, but at different speeds. It is lowest in Europe and highest in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>These widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower income earners and promote economic inclusion for all, regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity.</p>
        <p>Addressing income inequality requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance, and attracting foreign direct investment to regions where the need is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide.</p>
