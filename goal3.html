        <h2>Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages</h2>
        <p>We have made significant progress against several leading causes of death and disease. Life expectancy has increased dramatically; infant and maternal mortality rates have declined, and we've turned the tide on HIV and malaria, reducing deaths by half.</p>
        <p>Good health is essential to sustainable development, and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of health and development. It addresses economic and social inequalities, rapid urbanization, environmental threats, and the ongoing burden of infectious diseases, along with emerging challenges like noncommunicable diseases.</p>
        <p>Universal health coverage is integral to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty, and reducing inequalities. However, the world is currently off-track in achieving health-related SDGs, with progress being uneven both between and within countries.</p>
        <p>There exists a staggering 31-year gap in life expectancy between countries with the shortest and longest life spans. While some countries have made impressive gains, national averages can mask the many who are being left behind. Multisectoral, rights-based, and gender-sensitive approaches are essential to address these inequalities and promote good health for all.</p>
