        <h2>Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss</h2>
        <p>Human life depends on the Earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earthâ€™s surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and are crucial for clean air and water, as well as combating climate change.</p>
        <p>Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately affecting poor communities.</p>
        <p>While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants have been illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes biodiversity but also creates insecurity, fuels conflict, and feeds corruption.</p>
        <p>Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity, which are part of our common heritage and support global food and water security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and peace and security.</p>
