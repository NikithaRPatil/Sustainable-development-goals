        <h2>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</h2>
        <p>Ending all discrimination against women and girls is not only a basic human right, it’s crucial for a sustainable future; it’s proven that empowering women and girls helps economic growth and development.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has made gender equality central to its work, and we’ve seen remarkable progress in the past 20 years. There are more girls in school now compared to 15 years ago, and most regions have reached gender parity in primary education.</p>
        <p>However, although there are more women than ever in the labor market, there are still large inequalities in some regions, with women systematically denied the same work rights as men. Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office all remain huge barriers. Climate change and disasters continue to have a disproportionate effect on women and children, as do conflict and migration.</p>
        <p>It is vital to give women equal rights to land and property, sexual and reproductive health, and access to technology and the internet. Today, there are more women in public office than ever before, but encouraging more women leaders will help achieve greater gender equality.</p>
