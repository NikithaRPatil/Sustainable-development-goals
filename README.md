# Sustainable-development-goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 global objectives established by the United Nations in 2015 to tackle urgent issues by 2030. They aim to end poverty (Goal 1) and hunger (Goal 2), promote good health (Goal 3), and ensure quality education (Goal 4). Gender equality (Goal 5) and access to clean water (Goal 6) are also emphasized, alongside affordable energy (Goal 7) and decent work (Goal 8).

Sustainable industrialization (Goal 9), reduced inequalities (Goal 10), and sustainable cities (Goal 11) are key focus areas. Responsible consumption (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), and marine conservation (Goal 14) underscore environmental sustainability. Protecting terrestrial ecosystems (Goal 15) and promoting peace and justice (Goal 16) are vital for social stability. Lastly, partnerships (Goal 17) are essential for achieving these ambitious goals globally.
