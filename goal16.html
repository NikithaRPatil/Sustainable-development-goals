        <h2>Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels</h2>
        <p>We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance based on the rule of law. Yet our world is increasingly divided. Some regions enjoy peace, security, and prosperity, while others fall into seemingly endless cycles of conflict and violence. This is not inevitable and must be addressed.</p>
        <p>Armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a countryâ€™s development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in grievances that last for generations. Sexual violence, crime, exploitation, and torture are also prevalent where there is conflict or no rule of law, and countries must take measures to protect those who are most at risk.</p>
        <p>The SDGs aim to significantly reduce all forms of violence and work with governments and communities to end conflict and insecurity. Promoting the rule of law and human rights are key to this process, as is reducing the flow of illicit arms and strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.</p>
        <p>It is essential to create effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels to ensure justice and empower the marginalized. Building these institutions will foster sustainable peace and allow communities to thrive, ultimately contributing to global security and stability.</p>
